\usage{
VectorizedTo3DArray(df, ExEm)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe with vectorized fluorescence data in the format from the
CA WSC with one column containing both the Excitation and Emission pair, and
all other columns representing a sample (e.g.,GRnumber)}

\item{ExEm}{the character name of column with Excitation and Emmission wavelengths
defined in this format: ###/###. For example, Excitation 250 and emmission 400
would be represented as "250/400".}
}
\value{
an array with 3-D fluorescence  results. The 3 dimensions are the excitation wavelength (character), the emission wavelength (character), and the sample number, e.g.,"GRnumber" (character).
}
\description{
Converts vectorized fluorescence dataframe into a 3-D array with Ex, Em, and
GRnumber as the dimensions. This results in one 2-D excitation-emmission array
per sample. Requires the reshape2 package.
}
\examples{
df <- dfFluor
ExEm <- "Wavelength.Pairs"
aTest <- VectorizedTo3DArray(df,ExEm)
}
