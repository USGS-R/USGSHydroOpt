\usage{
getMeanFl(a, signals, Peak, Ex1, Ex2, Em1, Em2, dataSummary, grnum)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{an array with 3-D fluorescence  results. The 3 dimensions are the excitation wavelength (character), the emission wavelength (character), and the sample number (character).
This function assumes names of the third dimension in this array are sample numbers (GRnumber)}

\item{signals}{dataframe defining the max and min excitation (integer) and the max and
min emmission (integer) wavelengths for which to compute averages. Contains one column (character) with the names of the various parameters (e.g.,OB1,S1.50,B,T).}

\item{Peak}{character column for the column in signals with parameters to be computed}

\item{Ex1}{the first integer excitation wavelength in the range}

\item{Ex2}{the second integer excitation wavelength in the range. This can be blank
if one specific excitation wavelength is used.}

\item{Em1}{the first integer emmission wavelength in the range}

\item{Em2}{the second integer emmission wavelength in the range. This can be blank
if one specific emmission wavelength is used.}

\item{dataSummary}{dataframe with summary absorbance and fluoresence data. This
function adds columns to the end of this dataframe as additional summary data.}

\item{grnum}{character column name that defines the grnumbers in the dataSummary dataframe.}
}
\value{
dataSummary dataframe with the additional freshness index columns.
}
\description{
Computes different excitation-emission (EEM) signals from fluoresence data and adds them to a summary optical dataframe.
